To create the package.json file, copy the minimal package.json file
for this application and move the dependencies to devDependencies.  We
are using AWS Lambda Layers and the node_modules generated by the
dependencies attribute live in the corresponding package.json in the
libs/nodejs folder. In fact, there's nothing in there save for the
modules and the package.json file.

Right now, that layer contains mongoDB and AWS client code. That might
be enough code for our needs. Eventually, we might want some shared
code to be used by more lambda functions. That code could go in the
aforementioned layer or it could go into its own layer if we wish to
share db+aws across a number of common applications that don't need
the code to be shared amongst functions within this Stack.
